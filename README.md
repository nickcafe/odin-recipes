# odin-recipes

Created 3 recipe pages along with a home page that links to all 3 recipes! 

Used the new skills I learned with setting up an HTML index page, using relative links to link to other pages on my site, used basic HTML tags to create the recipe pages like: headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists (unordered and ordered), bolding text.

 Also used the command line to use git to upload my project to GitHub.
